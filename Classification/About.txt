Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

The workflow is:
    1. Loading the dataset (checking for null values and describe about it)
    2. Analyzing and visualing the dataset
    3. Training the Model
    4. Evaluating the Model
    5. testing the Model of new featues or data(value)
    6. Saving the Model the predictions on a Pickle file
